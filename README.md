# Data-115---Mima-Muhina-Project


## Dataset Background:


Communities within the United States. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR it was donated on 07-13-2009. The data set has 128 attributes that involve the communities that either affected or considered with why and what crimes happen such as percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, The attributes were measured as percentages and the violent crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, and assault were calculated and compared with attributes if there are any correlations. The data has 128 attributes consisting of the state, county, and community names as well as percentage of race populations, wages, employment, marital status, children, and police in the area are just a few; with the attributes there are missing values. This is a little bit about the community and crime dataset that I will be doing the data science process to analyze and describe the big question.


## Background Selection:


I've chosen the community and crime dataset. Communities and crimes are intertwined. when people look at crimes, they consider the setting, the environment, and what kind of area it is at. A community's level of poverty, social class,educational opportunities, and access to healthcare is just a few of the many factors that can lead to crime. Rape, robbery, assault, and murder is among the community's criminal offenses. Iâ€™ll be using the data process to view the raw data, analyze and clean it to compute the exploratory data analysis that consist of algorithms and models and visualizations to communicate my findings, analysis, and process.


## Big Question:

What causes people to commit violent crimes and what circumstances in people's life give rise to violent crimes is the big question I want to address. What state has had the most violent crime?,what age group is connected with violent crimes?, family structure such as divorce, how many parents are present, education, race is what I want to consider as I prepare a response to the big question. What state has had the most violent crime? My initial observation regarding the data was that there are numerous characteristics and attributes of the community and crimes, including age range and relationship status of many of the crimes committed by people from divorced parents.


## Dataset: 

This UCI Machine Learning Communities and Crime: 128 attributes.Using the head() function looking at the first six rows, that helped me get an overview of what the data is like, looking at the first 6 rows of each columns i notice that majority of the columns show the percentage while some of the columns like LemasSwornFT,PctPolicMinor, and PoliceCars have NA or missing data in all six rows, while the columns county have 3 missing data.
